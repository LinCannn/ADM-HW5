    "# 3. Finding Best Routes (Q3)\n",

    "## Task: Finding the Best Flight Routes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When planning to fly to a specific city, the goal is to find the **most efficient and fastest flight** that minimizes the **total distance flown**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on flights operating on a **specific day**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Considerations:\n",
    "- Each city may have **multiple airports**.  \n",
    "- The function should compute the **best route** for every possible pair of airports between the two cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if city **A** has airports \\( a_1, a_2 \\) and city **B** has airports \\( b_1, b_2 \\), the function should calculate the best routes for:\n",
    "-  `a₁ → b₁`\n",
    "-  `a₁ → b₂`\n",
    "-  `a₂ → b₁`\n",
    "-  `a₂ → b₂`\n",
    "\n",
    "If no valid route exists for a given pair, it should be reported as **\"No route found\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Inputs:\n",
    "1. **Flights network**: A graph representation of the flight data (airports and distances).\n",
    "2. **Origin city name**: The starting city.\n",
    "3. **Destination city name**: The target city.\n",
    "4. **Considered Date**: The specific date for which flights are being analyzed, in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Output:\n",
    "A table with the following three columns:\n",
    "1. **`Origin_city_airport`**: The code of the origin airport.\n",
    "2. **`Destination_city_airport`**: The code of the destination airport.\n",
    "3. **`Best_route`**: A list of airport names showing the order of travel in the optimal route.  \n",
    "   - The route should minimize the total distance flown.  \n",
    "   - If no valid route exists, the entry should display **\"No route found\"**.\n",
