    "## Algorithmic Question (AQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Arya needs to travel between cities using a network of flights. Each flight has a fixed cost (in euros), and she wants to find the cheapest possible way to travel from her starting city to her destination city. However, there are some constraints on the journey:\n",
    "\n",
    "Arya can make at most k stops during her trip (this means up to k+1 flights).\n",

    "Your Task\\ \n",
    "\n",
    "a) Write a pseudocode that describes the algorithm to find the cheapest route with at most k stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Implement the algorithm in Python and simulate the given test cases.\n",

    "c) Analyze the algorithm's efficiency. Provide its time complexity and space complexity, and explain whether it is efficient for large graphs (e.g., n > 100).\n",

    "d) Optimize the algorithm to handle larger graphs. Provide an updated pseudocode and analyze the computational complexity of your optimization.\n",
